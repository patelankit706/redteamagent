# 🤖 AI Red Team Crew

An autonomous, AI-powered multi-agent system designed to simulate cybersecurity red team engagements. This platform leverages the power of **CrewAI**, **Cerebras Inference API** and **Llama 3.3** to automate the entire attack lifecycle, from reconnaissance to privilege escalation, all managed through a clean **Streamlit** user interface.

## ✨ Core Features

*   **🤖 Autonomous Agent System:** Utilizes a crew of specialized AI agents (Coordinator, Recon, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation) that work together to achieve their objectives.
*   **🚀 Powered by Cerebras Llama 3.3 API:** Leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of the Llama 3.3 70b model (via the high-speed Cerebras API) for intelligent decision-making.
*   **🖥️ Interactive GUI:** A user-friendly Streamlit interface for configuring targets, launching missions, and viewing results in real-time.
*   **📝 Live Logging & Reporting:** Watch the agents work in real-time with a live log stream and receive a detailed, automatically-generated final report detailing the entire attack narrative.
*   **🛠️ Real Tools, Real Results:** Integrates and orchestrates real-world cybersecurity tools like `Nmap`, `GoBuster`, `Whois`, and more to perform its tasks.
*   **🧠 Intelligent Web Search:** Agents actively use web search to research potential vulnerabilities for discovered services, mimicking a key step in a real operator's workflow.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The application operates on CrewAI's `hierarchical` process, where a **Coordinator Agent** acts as the mission manager.

1.  **Mission Start:** The user provides a target (domain or IP) via the Streamlit UI.
2.  **Task Delegation:** The Coordinator assigns the **Reconnaissance** task to the specialist agent.
3.  **Execution & Logging:** The Recon Agent executes its toolchain (`Nmap`, `GoBuster`, web searches) and meticulously logs the full, raw output of every action to an intermediate report file (`recon_report.md`).
4.  **Handoff:** The Coordinator passes the context to the **Exploitation Agent**, which reads the recon report, researches exploits, and attempts to gain initial access, logging its actions to `exploit_report.md`.
5.  **Escalation:** The **Post-Exploitation Agent** takes over, attempting to escalate privileges and logging its findings to `privesc_report.md`.
6.  **Final Synthesis:** The Coordinator Agent's final task is to read all intermediate reports and compile them into a single, detailed, and chronologically-ordered final attack narrative.

## 🚀 Setup Option 1: Manual Installation

Follow these steps to get the AI Red Team Crew up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites: System Tools

The AI agents control real command-line tools. You **must** have them installed on your system.

**For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems (like Kali Linux, Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap gobuster sqlmap hydra whois -y
```

### 2. Setup: Python Environment & Dependencies

It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/patelankit706/redteamagent.git
cd redteamagent

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment using uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install the required Python packages
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration: API Keys

The application requires API keys for the LLM (Cerebras) and the web search tool (Serper).

 Get your API keys from following url:

```env
# Get your cerebras key from https://www.cerebras.ai/

# Get your key from https://serper.dev/
```

### 4. Running the Application

Once the prerequisites are installed and your API keys are configured, launch the Streamlit app with a single command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit in your browser, configure your target, cerebras and serper api keys in the sidebar and launch the crew!

---

## 🚀 Setup Option 2: Running with Docker prebuilt image (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to run the application, as it handles all system and Python dependencies automatically.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed and running on your system.


### Run the Docker Container
```bash
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 patelankit706/ml_ai_sec:latest
```
Navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit in your browser, configure your target, cerebras and serper api keys in the sidebar and launch the crew!

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Improvements

This project is a basic functional prototype with many avenues for expansion:

*   [ ] **Add More Tools:** Integrate more tools for different phases (e.g., password cracking, vulnerability scanning).
*   [ ] **Persistence Agent:** Create a new agent responsible for establishing persistence on the target.
*   [ ] **Windows Target Support:** Develop tools and agent prompts specifically for Windows environments.
*   [ ] **C2 Framework Integration:** Connect the agents to a simple Command & Control framework for more complex post-exploitation.
*   [ ] **User-Selectable Models:** Allow users to choose different LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) via the UI.
