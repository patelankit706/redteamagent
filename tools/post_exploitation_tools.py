        [+] Sudo rules:
        User user may run the following commands on this host:
            (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find

        [+] SUID Binaries:

        [+] Cron Jobs:
        - (root) /usr/local/bin/backup.sh

        [+] Interesting Writable Files:
        - /etc/passwd is writable by user 'user'

        =====================================
        Analysis:
        - The user can run 'find' with sudo without a password. This can be abused for a root shell.
        - The /etc/passwd file is writable, which could allow for adding a new root user.
        =====================================
